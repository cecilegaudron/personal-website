                <p>I have been working on web projects for more than fifteen years now. First of all in a self-taught way with sites
                    a little shaky and not always successful. This time did not last, because I obtained a diploma of multimedia
                    infographist which allowed me to learn and understand the fundamentals. Some time later, the discovery of
                    Wordpress lost me to take a new flight and create more successful websites.

                    <br>
                    For almost ten years, I worked as a content manager. I writed and designed content to communicate and share.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Today, thanks to Code Institute's Full Stack Software Developer training, I can embrace a new aspect of the web
                    : the creation of a web project from A to Z !
